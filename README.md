# blender-addons

This repo will include almost all the scripts/addons I'll be developing.

## Resources

This list will be updated as the time passes

[Olav 3D InstaSmooth Addon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdvRKx500ck): This inspired me the most to look into addon development. _Sub_Smooth_ is the same implementation of the addon by me.

[Midge Sinnaeve' Art Stream 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bK3juor2-c): Midge's suggestion of turning commonly repeated tasks into scripts is a great advice and the whole stream is a must watch.

[Blender's Official Docs](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html): I little bit difficult to follow, but it's probably me since I'm just getting into it and have a long way to go.

[Jacques Luke's Starter Kit](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/blender_vscode): A good VSCode extension to get started.
